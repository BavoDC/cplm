================
Version 0.2-1
================
NEW FEATURES

   o The package now implements MCMC methods for Bayesian compound 
	Poisson GLM in the function "bcpglm" with the use of 
	latent variables.      
   o The R package "coda" is imported so that a large number of functions 
	and methods defined there are now directly applicable to 
	the simulation results from "bcpglm" to help diagnose convergence
	and summarize posterior inference. 

CHANGES:
   (user-visable)	
   o Various methods defined for the class "bcplm" and "bcpglm"
   (not user-visable, all in C code):
   o Change the use of "R_alloc" in "lbfgsb" to "Calloc" and "Free" 
	(the old function eats up memory quickly)
   o Simplify rejection sampling of latent variables (now twice faster)

================
Version 0.1-3 (not released)
================
CHANGES (not user-visable, all in C code):
   o Fix a bug in rejection sampling of the latent variable 
   o Fix a bug in specifying weights
   o Divide cpglm_str into three parts, one for data and parameters, 
	one for latent variable, and one for EM related 

================
Version 0.1-2
================
NEW FEATURES

   o Add a wrapper of the profile likelihood approach to the "cpglm" 
     function that runs automatically to generate estimate of the 
     index parameter to arbitrary accuracy.

CHANGES:

   o The MCEM algorithm is now implemented in pure C code
   o Remove the restrict on the "weights" argument (but not tested)
   o Add "beta.step" in "control" to allow skips in the update of beta
   o Allow "link" to be both character and numeric
   o Force coercion of argument type before callings the C function
 	- thanks Mikel Esnaola Acebes for pointing out this bug
   o Re-write "summary" and "show" function to produce statistical
	test output automatically
   o Revise "residuals" to allow different types of residuals to be computed
   o Add methods for "formula", "AIC", "deviance", "model.matrix", "terms"
   o Output now returns "deviance", "aic" and "model.frame"
   o Tracing info from MCEM tidied up by showing only the dispersion, the
	index parameter, and the sample size (if necessary)
   o Fix bug in the definition of "[[", add methods for "["
